    "    iii) input capture: to measure the frequency of an external event\n",

    "    iv)  One-Pulse Mode:  is a particular case of the input capture mode and the output compare mode. It allows the counter to be started in response to a stimulus and to generate a pulse with a programmable length after a programmable delay\n",
